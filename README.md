# lox-audioserver

Modern TypeScript implementation of the Loxone Audio Server that lets you run your own
player backends (required) and, optionally, media providers while keeping the Miniserver API
happy. It exposes the same HTTP/WebSocket surface as the original firmware so existing apps,
Touch/Miniservers, and integrations can keep talking to it without modification.

The project currently ships with working Bang & Olufsen BeoLink and Music Assistant support, but the modular design makes it straightforward to plug in other systems.

## Features

- üéß **Zone backends**: Music Assistant, Beolink, and a stub Sonos implementation that
  demonstrates how to integrate additional clients.
- üìª **Media providers (optional)**: Music Assistant provider with full library/radio/playlist
  support. If no provider is configured, the built-in dummy provider returns empty lists so
  clients remain responsive.
- üß© **Extensible core**: Clean separation between request routing, providers, and zone
  backends to make future integrations easy.

## Requirements

- Node.js **20** or newer (the repo uses `@tsconfig/node20`).
- npm (ships with Node) for dependency management.
- A configured Loxone Miniserver if you want to pair with real hardware.
- Easiest deployment: use the published Docker image (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)).

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server exposes two endpoints by default:

   - `7091` ‚Äì `AppHttp` (used by Loxone apps / WebSocket clients and the admin UI).
   - `7095` ‚Äì `msHttp` (used by the Miniserver itself).

   During development you can use the watcher to run TypeScript directly:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

4. **Configure via the admin UI**

   Visit `http://<lox-audioserver-ip>:7091/admin` to enter Miniserver credentials, pair the audio server,
   assign backends/providers, and adjust logging levels. Configuration is stored in
   `data/config.json`.

5. **Run via Docker (from GitHub Container Registry)**

   Every release publishes a multi-arch image to GHCR. Replace `VERSION` with a published tag
   (or use `latest`).

   ```bash
   docker run \
     -p 7091:7091 \
     -p 7095:7095 \
     -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
     ghcr.io/rudyberends/rudyberends/lox-audioserver:VERSION

   The workflow `.github/workflows/create-release-and-build.yml` bumps the version, builds,
   and pushes the image automatically whenever changes land on `main`.

## Configuring Loxone

1. **Add the Audio Server in Loxone Config** ‚Äì You start with two stereo outputs. Right-click
   an output and choose **Split** if you want additional zones; Loxone will expose four mono
   outputs (the signal remains whatever your backend produces). Set the Audio Server parameters:
   - `IP` ‚Üí the address of the machine/container running this lox-audioserver.
   - `SerialNumber` ‚Üí `50:4F:94:FF:1B:B3` (expected hardware ID).
   Drag each output into your project to create Player blocks.
2. **Collect Player IDs** ‚Äì Each Player block shows a `Player-ID`. Note these numbers; you will
   map them to backends in the admin UI.
3. **Deploy to the Miniserver** ‚Äì After saving the project, reboot the Miniserver so the new
   Audio Server configuration is persisted. Once it‚Äôs back online, the Loxone config is
   available at `http://<MINISERVER_IP>/dev/fsget/prog/Music.json`; the lox-audioserver downloads this
   file during startup to understand the Audio Server layout. **If either the IP or
   SerialNumber differs from the values above, this file will not populate and pairing will
   fail.** Initially the icon will show *‚Äúnot fully configured‚Äù* until the pairing process has completed.
4. **Configure the lox-audioserver** ‚Äì Open the admin UI at `http://<lox-audioserver-ip>:7091/admin` and enter the
   Miniserver credentials. Use the **Pair** button to pair with the MiniServer`. Once paired,
   assign each Player ID to a backend:
   - `BackendMusicAssistant` ‚Äì control Music Assistant players. Requires a Music Assistant Player ID per zone.
   - `BackendBeolink` ‚Äì control Bang & Olufsen devices via Beolink notifications/API (one device
     per zone).
   - `BackendSonos` / `BackendExample` ‚Äì sample implementations illustrating how to integrate
     additional clients.
5. **(Optional) Configure a media provider** ‚Äì Choose `MusicAssistantProvider` to surface Music Assistant content. Providers and
   backends must match; e.g. the Music Assistant provider requires `BackendMusicAssistant`
   zones.

When the lox-audioserver starts successfully and the Miniserver pairs successfully with the lox-audioserver, the Audio Server icon in
Loxone Config turns green.

## Web Administration

An always-on admin UI ships with the server at `http://<lox-audioserver-ip>:7091/admin`.

- View and edit Miniserver credentials, zone/back-end mappings, and media provider settings.
- When the audio server is unpaired, the admin UI shows only the Miniserver credentials along with a **Pair** button that writes the config and retries pairing.
- Refresh Music Assistant player lists when a zone is missing a player ID‚Äîthe UI surfaces the
  available IDs reported by the backend instead of printing them to the console.

## Configuration Overview

All settings are stored in `data/config.json`. The
admin UI reads and writes this file for you.

- **Beolink/Sonos backends** expect a one-to-one mapping: each zone points to a dedicated
  device IP.
- **MusicAssistant backend** can control many players on the same server. Set `maPlayerId` for
  each zone using the ‚ÄúPlayer ID‚Äù from Music Assistant ‚Üí Player settings.

| Zone backend | Compatible provider(s)                   | Notes |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `BackendMusicAssistant` | `MusicAssistantProvider`, `DummyProvider` | Requires `maPlayerId`; multiple zones can share one MA host. |
| `BackendBeolink`        | `BeolinkProvider`, `DummyProvider`                           | One device per zone via its IP. |
| `BackendSonos` / `BackendExample` | `DummyProvider`                 | Stub/sample implementations; extend to add real provider support. |

## Code Structure

```
src/
  backend/           // Zone backends (Music Assistant, Beolink, Sonos stub, examples)
  backend/provider/  // Media providers and provider factory
  http/              // HTTP + WebSocket routing layer
  config/            // Miniserver/audio-server configuration handling
  utils/             // Logging and helpers
```

- **HTTP layer** (`src/http/handlers`) contains typed route handlers grouped by concern
  (`config`, `provider`, `zone`, `secure`). `requesthandler.ts` wires them into the Loxone
  command router used by both HTTP and WebSocket paths.
- **Providers** expose radios/playlists/library folders. The Music Assistant provider uses
  dedicated services for radio, playlist, and library browsing.
- **Zone backends** translate Loxone player commands into backend-specific APIs.

## Extending the Server

- **Add a new zone backend**: create a subclass of `Backend` under
  `src/backend/zone/<YourBackend>`, implement the required methods (`initialize`,
  `sendCommand`, etc.), then register it in `backendFactory.ts`. Remember: backends only control
  client devices; media browsing is provided separately by the media provider.
- **Add a new media provider**: implement the `MediaProvider` interface under
  `src/backend/provider`, register it in `provider/factory.ts`, and document configuration
  variables. Ensure the designated zone backends understand the provider‚Äôs playback semantics
  (e.g., Music Assistant provider pairs with `BackendMusicAssistant`). Mixing incompatible
  providers/backends is not supported.

## Development Notes

- TypeScript sources live in `src/`; compiled output goes to `dist/` via `npm run build`.
- Logging uses a Winston-based logger (`src/utils/troxorlogger.ts`). Log levels are configured
  via the admin UI (stored in `data/config.json`).
- Graceful shutdown signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`) are handled in `src/server.ts`; staged
  clean-up (zone backends, servers) ensures repeatable restarts.

## Contributing

Pull requests for new providers/backends are welcome. Please run `npm run build` before
submitting to ensure the TypeScript output stays in sync.
